workbench.developerforce.com has been having problems with AWS (https://salesforce.stackexchange.com/questions/405728/unknown-error-read-error-on-connection-to-ec2-34-194-152-137-compute-1-amazonaw) for several days, would someone please fix this so that we can continue to use it?

This is the error message I see when trying to run a query: 

UNKNOWN ERROR: read error on connection to ec2-34-194-152-137.compute-1.amazonaws.com:6379
